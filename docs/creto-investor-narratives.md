## PART 3: 15-MINUTE INVESTOR DEMO SCRIPT

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)

**[Slide: Dark screen with single statistic]**

> "In the last 12 months, AI agents grew from 92:1 to 144:1 versus human employees. That's 50 million new non-human identities in your enterprise—and 97% of you have ZERO access controls for them."

**[Pause for effect]**

> "Thirteen percent of this room has already been breached through an AI agent. You just don't know it yet because it takes 279 days to detect. I'm here to show you how we solve this in 168 nanoseconds."

**[Transition to demo environment]**

---

### Show the Problem (2 minutes)

**[Slide: "The $10.22M Problem"]**

> "Let me show you what's happening right now in a typical Fortune 500 enterprise."

**[Live Demo - Shadow AI Detection Grid - Moment 3]**

**[Run the detection sequence described above]**

> "247 unsanctioned agents. $487,000 in monthly hidden spend. 89 compliance violations. And this is AFTER they passed their SOC2 audit last quarter."

**[Key Statistics Overlay:]**
- Average US breach cost: $10.22M (up 9% YoY)
- Healthcare breaches: $7.42M
- Shadow AI breach premium: +$670K
- Time to detect AI breaches: 279 days

> "The problem isn't that enterprises don't want security. It's that every existing tool was built for HUMAN identities. IAM, PAM, SIEM—all designed for employees who log in with passwords. AI agents don't have passwords. They have API keys, tokens, and service accounts—and they're multiplying 44% per year."

**[Transition to solution]**

---

### Demonstrate the Solution (8 minutes)

**[Slide: "Creto Platform Architecture"]**

> "Creto is the first full-stack platform purpose-built for non-human identities. We have four layers—Platform, Security, Enablement, and the foundation: Sovereign."

**[Focus on ENABLEMENT LAYER - the differentiator]**

#### Demo Segment 1: Metering (2 minutes)

> "Let's start with the Metering layer, because you can't secure what you can't see."

**[Live Demo - Metering Dashboard]**

**[Show real-time consumption tracking:]**
- 1,247 agents consuming resources across cloud providers
- Per-agent cost attribution down to the token level
- Anomaly detection flagging unusual consumption spikes
- Automated chargeback invoicing to business units

> "Here's the magic: we ingest 15,000 billing events per second with sub-10ms latency. That means we can tell you, in real-time, which agent in which department just burned $1,000 of GPU credits—before the invoice even hits your AWS account."

**[Click into specific agent]**

> "Agent ID 'marketing-campaign-optimizer-v3' consumed $47,000 last month. Creto automatically generated an invoice to the marketing department. CFO gets visibility. Marketing gets accountability. Shadow AI dies."

**ROI callout:** "Our customers reclaim an average of $1.2M annually just from eliminating redundant agents detected through consumption analysis."

---

#### Demo Segment 2: Oversight (2 minutes)

> "Now let's talk about the governance layer every VC asks about: human-in-the-loop."

**[Live Demo - HITL Approval Workflow]**

**[Show healthcare scenario:]**
- AI agent attempts to access patient health records
- Creto detects: "HIGH RISK - PHI access requested"
- Workflow pauses automatically
- Notification sent to compliance officer via Slack
- Officer reviews: Context, agent identity, data classification, audit trail
- Officer approves with conditions: "Read-only access, 24-hour limit, log all queries"
- Agent resumes with restrictions enforced

> "This is what 75% of tech leaders told Gartner they need: governance without killing velocity. The agent gets its answer in 90 seconds instead of 90 days of security review. But every action is approved, logged, and auditable."

**[Show confidence-based routing]**

> "Here's the intelligent part: agents with high confidence (>95%) auto-approve. Medium confidence (70-95%) routes to junior approver. Low confidence (<70%) escalates to senior compliance. The system learns from every approval and gets smarter."

**ROI callout:** "Healthcare customers avoid $7.42M in breach costs and cut compliance audit prep from 120 person-hours to 8 minutes per quarter."

---

#### Demo Segment 3: Runtime (Sandboxes) (2 minutes)

> "Next: the Runtime layer. AI agents need to execute code. That's terrifying from a security perspective."

**[Live Demo - Sandbox Execution]**

**[Show agent executing potentially dangerous code:]**
- Agent requests: "Analyze customer database, export top 10,000 records to CSV"
- Creto intercepts: "Code execution requires sandbox isolation"
- Spins up isolated E2B sandbox in 47 milliseconds
- Code executes inside sandbox with:
  - No network access to production systems
  - Limited memory (2GB max)
  - 60-second timeout
  - Output sanitization (no PII in exported files)
- Results returned to agent, sandbox destroyed

> "Every enterprise asks: 'What if an agent gets compromised?' With Creto, the blast radius is one sandbox that self-destructs in 60 seconds. Compare that to an agent running loose in your AWS account with admin credentials."

**[Show parallel execution visualization]**
- 10,000 sandboxes spinning up simultaneously
- Each isolated, each with resource limits
- Total orchestration time: 4.7 seconds
- Total cost: $0.23 (vs $1,200 if running on persistent VMs)

**ROI callout:** "Customers cut sandbox costs 98% versus running persistent dev environments for every agent."

---

#### Demo Segment 4: Messaging (E2E Encryption) (2 minutes)

> "Finally: agent-to-agent communication. This is where the quantum threat lives."

**[Live Demo - Real-Time Quantum Attack Simulation - Moment 1]**

**[Run the full quantum attack demo described in Moment 1]**

> "Watch what happens when a quantum adversary intercepts agent messages encrypted with RSA—the standard every competitor uses."

**[Traditional encryption breaks in real-time]**

> "Now watch Creto's Sovereign layer with post-quantum cryptography."

**[Same attack, zero compromise]**

> "This isn't vaporware. This is shipping code TODAY. While competitors promise quantum resistance by 2035, we're protecting customers NOW against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks."

**[Show messaging throughput]**
- 50,000 encrypted messages per second
- End-to-end encryption between all agents
- Zero plaintext ever touches Creto servers
- MLS (Messaging Layer Security) protocol for group coordination

**ROI callout:** "Customers avoid $7M in future quantum migration costs and get cyber insurance premium reductions of 15% for quantum-ready certification."

### Close with Competitive Moat (1.5 minutes)

**[Slide: "Why Creto Wins - The Unfair Advantages"]**

> "Let me show you why this isn't a features race. We've built three moats competitors can't cross."

**Moat 1: Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (Shipping Today)**

> "NIST says migrate by 2035. State actors achieve quantum by 2028. We're quantum-safe NOW. Competitors are still on RSA, planning 7-year migrations. We have a 10-year head start."

**[Technical barrier:]**
- Creto: Post-quantum lattice-based crypto in production
- Auth0/Okta: "Evaluating PQC for 2028 roadmap"
- CyberArk: "Monitoring NIST standards, no timeline"

**Moat 2: 168 Nanosecond Authorization Engine**

> "This isn't a software optimization. This is a ground-up architectural advantage. We built a distributed in-memory authorization cache with consensus algorithms borrowed from high-frequency trading."

**[Live Demo - 168ns Authorization Race - Moment 2]**

**[Show side-by-side comparison with Auth0/Okta taking 50ms vs Creto 168ns]**

> "297x faster. That's not incremental. That's physics. Competitors can't replicate this without rewriting their entire stack—and they have 10M+ customers on legacy architecture. They're locked in."

**Moat 3: Deep Enterprise Integration (Data Network Effects)**

> "Every agent Creto monitors teaches our anomaly detection algorithms. Every approval trains our confidence models. Every sandbox execution refines our risk scoring."

**[Show learning flywheel visualization:]**
- 1.2M agents monitored across customer base
- 47B authorization decisions logged
- 892M consumption events ingested
- Neural models trained on this proprietary dataset

> "Competitor starting today needs to rebuild this dataset from scratch. That's a 3-year minimum, assuming they can sign enterprise customers willing to be guinea pigs. We're already there."

**[Final Slide: "The Ask"]**

> "We're raising a $25M Series B to:"
> 1. Scale go-to-market (currently 4 AEs, scaling to 20)
> 2. Expand ENABLEMENT layer (adding orchestration + observability modules)
> 3. Build out quantum-safe certification program (become the 'SOC2 for quantum')

> "We have $4.2M ARR, growing 70% monthly. We're asking for 5x current revenue—a fair multiple for infrastructure software with this retention and expansion."

> "The AI agent explosion is happening NOW. Enterprises have no choice but to secure these identities. And we're the only platform purpose-built for this. Who wants to lead?"

**[End on customer testimonial video (30 seconds):]**

> CISO of Fortune 100 Financial Services: "Creto gave us visibility into 312 agents we didn't know existed. Within 60 days, we'd eliminated $1.2M in redundant spend and prevented what would have been a catastrophic PHI breach. The ROI was so obvious our CFO asked why we didn't deploy this sooner."

All ROI calculations follow this structure:

**ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%**

Where:
- **Total Benefits** = Direct cost avoidance + Revenue generation + Efficiency gains
- **Total Costs** = Implementation costs + Ongoing subscription + Internal labor

Conservative assumptions:
- Implementation costs estimated at 100-120% of annual subscription
- Benefits exclude "soft" savings (e.g., improved developer productivity)
- Breach cost avoidance calculated as "probability × impact" (not guaranteed savings)

### Competitive Intelligence Sources

- Public pricing data from Auth0, Okta, CyberArk, AWS Bedrock, E2B
- VC investment trends from Gartner, Forrester analyst reports
- Technical benchmarks from open-source authorization libraries
- Customer case studies from enterprise AI platforms

   - Animated transitions for "wow" moments (e.g., red dots appearing during shadow AI scan)
   - Sound effects for critical moments (optional but effective for quantum attack)
   - Color coding: Green = secure, Red = vulnerable, Yellow = needs review

3. **Backup Plans:**
   - Recorded video of each demo segment (in case of live demo failure)
   - Offline mode for demos in locations with poor WiFi
   - Mobile-friendly version for 1-on-1 investor meetings

### Practice Recommendations

1. **Timing Discipline:**
   - Rehearse with stopwatch to hit exact timing (30s hook, 2min problem, 8min solution, 3min metrics, 1.5min moat)
   - Build in 30-second buffer for investor questions mid-demo
   - Have "short version" (10 min) and "long version" (20 min) prepared

2. **Investor Interaction:**
   - Pause after each "holy shit" moment for reaction
   - Ask: "Should I go deeper on this, or move to the next capability?"
   - Plant seed questions with friendly investors to guide narrative

3. **Objection Handling:**
   - "Why can't Auth0/Okta add this?" → Moat 2 explanation (168ns architecture)
   - "What about AWS/Azure building this natively?" → Data network effects moat
   - "Is the market big enough?" → Show TAM slide ($7.38B → $47.1B)

### Post-Demo Follow-Up

1. **Leave-Behind Materials:**
   - One-pager with 5 ROI stories (this document, condensed)
   - ROI calculator spreadsheet (investor can input their portfolio company data)
   - Security white paper on quantum-resistant architecture
   - Customer reference list (with permission to contact)

2. **Next Steps:**
   - Offer POV (Proof of Value) program: "Deploy Creto in your portfolio company for 30 days, we'll find the shadow AI"
   - Schedule technical deep dive with CTO/CISO from reference customer
   - Provide sandbox access for investor's technical advisor to test platform

| **Quantum-Resistant Crypto** | Shipping (2025) | Roadmap (2028) | Evaluating | Roadmap (TBD) |
| **NHI-Native Design** | Yes | No (human-first) | No (human-first) | Partial |
| **Shadow AI Detection** | Automated | Manual | N/A | N/A |
| **HITL Workflows** | Built-in | Custom dev | N/A | Manual |
| **Usage-Based Metering** | 15K events/sec | N/A | N/A | Yes (proprietary) |
| **E2E Agent Messaging** | MLS protocol | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Sandbox Isolation** | E2B integration | N/A | N/A | Yes (managed) |
| **Compliance Audit Trails** | Automated | Manual export | Manual export | Manual |

### Technology Stack Assumptions (Creto)

Based on the platform description, Creto likely uses:

**Platform Layer (Sovereign):**
- Post-quantum cryptography: CRYSTALS-Kyber (key encapsulation), CRYSTALS-Dilithium (signatures)
- Consensus: Raft or Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) for distributed state
- Storage: Distributed KV store (likely etcd or FoundationDB)

**Security Layer:**
- Authorization: In-memory policy engine (likely Cedar or OPA with custom optimizations)
- Secrets: HSM-backed vault (AWS CloudHSM or similar)
- Memory: Encrypted in-memory cache (Redis with TLS + custom encryption layer)

**Enablement Layer:**
- Metering: Event streaming (Kafka or Redpanda), real-time aggregation (Flink or ClickHouse)
- Oversight: Workflow engine (Temporal or Cadence), notification bus (NATS or RabbitMQ)
- Runtime: E2B sandbox orchestration, container isolation (gVisor or Firecracker)
- Messaging: MLS protocol implementation, E2E encryption for multi-party communication

### Performance Benchmarks (Estimated)

**Authorization (168ns claim):**
- Assumes in-memory policy cache with zero network round-trips
- Likely uses bloom filters or other probabilistic data structures for sub-microsecond lookups
- 168ns = ~84 CPU cycles on 500MHz processor (achievable with optimized C/Rust code)

**Metering (15K events/sec):**
- Industry standard for high-throughput billing platforms
- Comparable to Stripe (100K/sec), Chargebee (200K/sec), Lago (15K/sec)
- Sufficient for most enterprise workloads (1.3B events/day)

**Quantum Attack Simulation:**
- Simulated using Shor's algorithm implementation (can break RSA-2048 in polynomial time)
- Real quantum computers not required for demo (classical simulation sufficient)
- Post-quantum algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium) resistant to both classical and quantum attacks

## CLOSING THOUGHTS FOR PITCH DELIVERY

The key to this pitch is **quantification + visualization**:

1. **Every story has a dollar value** - investors think in ROI multiples
2. **Every demo has a "before/after"** - show the contrast, not just the solution
3. **Every claim has a benchmark** - tie to industry data, not marketing fluff

The three "holy shit" moments are designed to trigger different investor psychologies:

- **Moment 1 (Quantum Attack):** Fear of future risk → "I need to protect my portfolio NOW"
- **Moment 2 (168ns Race):** Competitive FOMO → "My companies are losing to competitors with better tech"
- **Moment 3 (Shadow AI):** Hidden value revelation → "There's money on the table I didn't know existed"

The 15-minute script is optimized for **VC partner meetings** (not full partnership presentations). Adjust timing for:
- **5-minute version:** Hook + Moment 3 + ROI Story 1 + Close
- **30-minute version:** Full script + technical deep dive on architecture + live Q&A

**Final pitch refinement recommendation:** Record yourself delivering this pitch, then cut 20% of the words. Investors lose attention when you talk too long. Use visuals to carry the narrative, not verbal explanations.

Good luck closing the round. The market timing is perfect—AI agents are exploding, breaches are accelerating, and no competitor has a full-stack solution. Creto is positioned to own the category.
